It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.


----------------------------- Jenkins Application -----------------------------------------

Jenkins helps to automate and accelerate the software development process.

1. Increased Code Coverage
Code coverage is determined by the number of lines of code a component has and 
how many of them get executed. Jenkins increases code coverage which ultimately 
promotes a transparent development process among the team members.

2. No Broken Code
Jenkins ensures that the code is good and tested well through continuous integration. 
The final code is merged only when all the tests are successful. This makes sure that no broken 
code is shipped into production
